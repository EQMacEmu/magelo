v2.41
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 28, 2014 - added a database stats gathering tool. Uncomment
                     the setting at the bottom of config.php and it will
                     cause every query, its runtime and an explanation
                     to be dumped at the bottom of each page. WARNING:
                     the dumped data is publicly viewable. (Maudigan)
                     Altered the profile class to have a constructor
                     that recieves the charname and populates the
                     basic character data. This permitted the removal
                     of an extra query on nearly every screen. (Maudigan)
September 29, 2014 - completed the character blob modifications.
                     this involved rewriting most of the profile.php
                     script and putting a bandaid on aa.php (Maudigan)
                     Added the missing AA tabs. (Maudigan)

v2.4 (beta)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
September 26, 2014 - Akkadius removed the character blob from the
                     database and triggered this update. All changes
                     are to accomodate the new storage method.
                     Rewrote profile.php, this involved removing old
                     comments; see old versions to view them.
                     Changed character_ table referenes to character_data
                     in multiple files.
                     Rewrote the code that grabbed a characters guild
                     name and rank as the the blob doesn't exist and the
                     new method doesnt track a character guild id. I used
                     this as an opportunity to swap from a WHERE join to
                     a standard JOIN. (Maudigan)
